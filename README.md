# Simon Says Game 🎮

A classic memory-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Test your memory by following the sequence of colors and sounds!

## 🚀 How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Press any key on your keyboard to begin.
2. **Watch the Pattern**: The game will flash a button (Pink, Yellow, Green, or Purple).
3. **Repeat the Pattern**: Click the buttons in the exact same order they appeared.
4. **Level Up**: Each time you successfully complete a sequence, the game adds one more step to the pattern.
5. **Game Over**: If you click the wrong button, it's game over! Your final score (level) will be displayed.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5**: For the game structure.
* **CSS3**: For the layout and button styling.
* **JavaScript**: For the game logic, event listeners, and sequence generation.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The main structure of the game.
* `style.css` - Custom styles for the colorful buttons and animations.
* `app.js` - The logic behind the game levels and user input validation.
